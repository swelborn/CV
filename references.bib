  abstract = {{The digitization of controls, data, and analysis in microscopy is bringing the idea of autonomous microscopes closer to reality than ever before. Automated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is already fairly routine for some experiments the only require simple repetitive tasks such as imaging biological macromolecules for single particle cryoEM [1], tilt series for electron tomography [2], and movies for crystallography [3]. The vast majority of TEM experiments are conducted completely by human operators who choose the regions of interest, optimize experimental parameters, and make decisions about data quality visually during an experiment. The field is still a long way from having completely autonomous TEMs that can adapt to sample difficulties and tune experimental parameters based on data quality and desired experimental outcomes. Part of the issue is the lack of capability for feeding information learned from on-line, live data analysis back into the on-going experiment [4]. This presentation will discuss current capabilities for large scale data reduction and analysis using high performance computing (i.e. supercomputing) and progress towards developing a true feed-back loop that places data analysis and theory in the experimental loop.}},

  abstract = {While dealloying is widely used to create nanoporous materials, it has rarely been employed to isolate difficult-to-synthesize intermediate phases. Here we show how air-free, electrolytic dealloying at room temperature can be used to isolate the ternary intermetallic Mg11Cu6Al12 phase. We create a ternary Mg-Cu-Al parent alloy containing the Mg11Cu6Al12 compound and other phases, then subsequently remove these other phases via electrolytic dealloying to isolate the Mg11Cu6Al12 phase. Isolated Mg11Cu6Al12 phase exhibits ≈1 μm diameter rod-shaped microstructure. Phase and chemical analysis conducted using various techniques, including inductively coupled plasma and lab and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, show minimal impurities. This new approach to isolate the Mg11Cu6Al12 phase can unlock its use in fundamental research and can be applied to other difficult-to-synthesize intermetallic compounds.},
